# COVID-19-Trends-Analysis-with-Prophet-Model

The COVID-19 Trends Analysis with Prophet Model project is a Data Science and Machine Learning initiative that aims to analyze historical trends and predict the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic across different countries. By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Prophet model, we aim to provide accurate and reliable predictions of the spread and impact of the virus. In addition, the project identifies factors that contribute to the transmission rate of COVID-19 and uses this knowledge to develop effective strategies to control the virus's spread. Through interactive visualizations and dashboards, users can explore the COVID-19 trends and understand potential outcomes based on different scenarios. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the larger scientific community's efforts to combat COVID-19 and support informed decision-making to mitigate the impact of the virus.
